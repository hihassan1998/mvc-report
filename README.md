# MVC Report

This is a student project developed as part of the MVC course at BTH (Blekinge Institute of Technology). The project is built using PHP and follows the Symfony framework structure with a clear MVC architecture.

## Project Structure

- `/src/Controller` – Contains all controllers responsible for handling business logic.
- `/templates` – Stores view files (HTML/Twig templates).
- `/public` – The web root and application entry point via `index.php`.
- `composer.json` – Manages PHP dependencies (similar to `package.json` in JavaScript).

## Content
This following section outlines the contributions made to the repository throughout the different course modules.

- **kmom01**: Introduction to the framework. Component and template creation with a "crazy" demo page and project setup for upcoming course modules.
- **kmom02**: Object-Oriented Programming – Includes the "Pig" game and a simple card game, both built using OOP principles.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or upload the files to your web directory.
2. Run `composer install` to install the required dependencies.
3. Make sure your `.htaccess` file is properly configured for your web server environment.
